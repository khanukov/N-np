Combines the cover obtained from low-sensitivity functions with the
subexponential cover from the family entropy lemma.  This statement is a
stub meant to capture the intended interface; a full constructive proof
is left for future work.

Placeholder theorem combining low-sensitivity covers with the
entropy-based family cover.  A full constructive proof remains
to be written.  The statement is kept as a theorem so that other
files may depend on it.-/
