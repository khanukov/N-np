===========

Top‑level **cover construction** for the Family Collision‑Entropy Lemma.

Interface
---------

* `mBound n h`         — the *numeric* bound
      `n·(h+2)·2^(10 h)` appearing in the spec;
* `cover_exists F h hH` — existential statement:
      a finite set `𝓡` of subcubes satisfying

  1.  every `R ∈ 𝓡` is **jointly monochromatic** for the whole family `F`;
  2.  for every function `f ∈ F`, every `1`‑input of `f`
      lies in (at least) one rectangle of `𝓡`;
  3.  `|𝓡| ≤ mBound n h`.

* `coverFamily F h hH` — a *choice* of such a cover (`noncomputable`).

Both the construction and the proof are currently marked `sorry`; they
depend on yet‑to‑be‑proved lemmas (`EntropyDrop`, `sunflower_exists`,
`coreAgreement`).  Still, the **API is frozen** and downstream files can
import and use `coverFamily` immediately.

Road‑map notes: filling the two `sorry` blocks below is milestone **E**
and **F** of the project plan.

**Existence lemma** — the heart of the FCE‑lemma’s constructive part.

Assume `H₂(F) ≤ h`.  Then there exists a finite set `𝓡` of subcubes
satisfying:  

* **(mono)** each `R ∈ 𝓡` is monochromatic for the entire family `F`;
* **(cover)** for every `f ∈ F` and every `x` with `f x = true`
  there is an `R ∈ 𝓡` such that `x ∈ R`;
* **(bound)** `|𝓡| ≤ mBound n h`.

     **Sketch of the intended constructive proof** (to be formalised):

     1.  *Initialisation*  
         Set `Rset := ∅`, `Fam := F`.

     2.  *Main loop (while there exists `f ∈ Fam` with a 1‑point uncovered)*  
         *Try Sunflower*  
         – Collect, for every `f`, the set of its **currently uncovered
           1‑points**.  Put all those points (over all `f`) into one large
           family `𝒮` of *sets of coordinates* (their support bits).  
         – If `|𝒮|` exceeds the classical Erdős–Rado bound
           `(p − 1)!·wᵖ` (with suitably chosen `w, p`),
           invoke `sunflower_exists` to obtain a common core `I`
           of size `≥ n − ℓ`.  
         – Use `Agreement.coreAgreement` with **two petals** to obtain a
           subcube `R` that is monochromatic `1` for *all* functions
           (colour `1` because the petals were 1‑inputs for every `f`).  
           Add `R` to `Rset`, mark all its points as covered, and repeat.

         *Entropy drop fallback*  
         – If Sunflower fails, use `EntropyDrop` to pick a coordinate
           `(i,b)` that lowers `H₂` by ≥ 1.  *Restrict* all functions
           to `x_i = b`.  Recurse on that smaller instance.  Since
           `H₂` starts ≤ `h`, at most `h` such restrictions happen.

     3.  *Termination & bound*  
         *Each* entropy‑drop adds **two** rectangles (one for `b=0`, one
         for `b=1`) whose union is the full cube, giving ≤ `2h` rectangles.  
         Each sunflower extraction removes ≥ `2^{n-ℓ}` points; with
         `ℓ = ⌈log₂ n⌉` there can be at most `n/ℓ` such extractions.  
         Hence  
            `|Rset| ≤ 2h + n/⌈log₂ n⌉ ≤ n·(h+2)·2^{10h}`.

     All operations preserve joint monochromaticity by construction.
     The full formalisation will follow this plan verbatim.
